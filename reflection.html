        <p>Before I delve into the reasons why I believe Git is good whilst being in a collaborative project
          environment, I’ll start by answering the first important question: What is Git?
          <br></br>Git is a version control system which allows users to commit changes to code overtime via the implementation
           of a Repository. A repository is a data control system which stores and records the changes made to the source
            code <a href = "https://towardsdatascience.com/a-quick-primer-to-version-control-using-git-3fbdbb123262">(Zheng, 2018)</a>.
            In conjunction with other services such as GitHub, it enables users to access these changes through the
             Cloud and remotely update the source code through their local repository.
          <br></br>The importance of implementing a Git Repository is exemplified in a collaborative project environment.
          When collaborating with other Designers, the creation of a Repository allows multiple users to work on the same
          code on different devices and commit their progress via GitHub. This method is possible through the Git
          Repository as it tracks specific changes made by those who contributed to the creation of the code
          <a href = "https://towardsdatascience.com/a-quick-primer-to-version-control-using-git-3fbdbb123262">(Zheng, 2018)</a>.
          This allows each Designer to work on a specific aspect of the code and enables the creation of rapid, functional
          prototypes for the client.
          <br></br>For designers, the creation of a repository is an easy way to present current updates of prototypes to other
          stakeholders <a href = "https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/why-git" >(Atlassian, n.d.)</a>. If other stakeholders want to change the user flow of a prototype, the repository
          allows Designers to revert to specific versions of code, ‘branch’ away from the current prototype and meet the
          demands of the stakeholder– without the risk of breaking the prototypes’ existing functionality.
          <br></br>As much as Git was hard to understand initially, I now understand the benefits of using this service. It
          allows us as designers to rapidly iterate prototypes to meet the client’s needs and serves as an external service
          to save the work that we spent way too much time on. </p>
