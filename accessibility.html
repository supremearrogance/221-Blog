        <h1>Reflection: Improving Website Accessibility</h1>
      </div>

      <div class = "reflection-paragraph">
          <p>Accessibility is an underlying issue that is present on many online sites.  For example, if a user has a lack of eyesight and has to zoom up on webpages to see, the site must look just as good as if it was viewed at 100%. Although there are a small number of users who have visual or hearing impairments, accommodating to them will make a big difference on their thoughts on the website and how they may suggest this service to their peers. Thus, the website I am creating for Bomber Breweries will be accessible to users who may have visual or hearing impairments – catering to more users and resulting in potential increases for Bomber Breweries’ revenue and profit.
          <br></br>To improve the page’s accessibility, the first thing I did was utilise the Document Object Model (DOM). This ensures that if the user operates using the ‘Tab’ button, the order of information will be correct and will lead them down the page in a sufficient matter. To do this, I made sure that each section was in the order of where it was on the page (e.g. Navigation Bar at the top of code). This allowed the tab order to be correct and makes it easier for the impaired user to navigate through the page.
          <br></br>Adding Alterative (Alt) text to each image is another way I have made this website more accessible to impaired users. Before Monday’s lecture, I never really used Alt text (Bad practice) in my code. However, after Monday’s lecture, I realised the importance of putting text in the image and the implications to impaired users if this was not placed in. Adding the text in allows visually impaired users to hear the description of the image through voice commands. This allows them to visualise the image in their brain and understand why it was placed on the webpage.
          <br></br>Potential additions to improve accessibility could be improving the layout of the page when zoomed up to 200%. Although this is an integral part to Accessibility, I am unsure on how to do this and have decided not to implement it in this week’s tutorial.
          Another potential accessibility idea could be allowing the user to choose whether they would prefer the website being displayed in ‘Night Mode’ or ‘Day Mode’. Having this feature would give them an option of what colour choice would best suit their impairment whilst navigating through the page. </p>
